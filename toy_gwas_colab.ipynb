    "### Why simulate population structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "In real genetic data, individuals from different populations (e.g., different ancestries) have different allele frequencies. This creates **population structure** - a correlation between genetic variants and population membership.\n",

    "- Dietary differences (e.g., traditional diets vs. Western diets)\n",

    "- Cultural factors (e.g., body image ideals)\n",
    "- Environmental factors (e.g., access to healthy food)\n",
    "\n",
    "If BMI differs between populations for these non-genetic reasons, and populations also have different allele frequencies, you might find \"significant\" genetic associations that are actually just due to population differences, not true genetic effects. This is called **confounding** or **population stratification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we're doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate two subpopulations with slightly different allele frequencies. This creates a simple form of population structure that will cause confounding in our BMI GWAS if we don't control for it."

    "\n",
    "1. **Genetic signal:** We pick a few \"causal\" SNPs that truly affect BMI (these represent real genetic variants that influence body weight)\n",
    "2. **Population effect (confounding):** We add an effect that differs between populations - this mimics real-world scenarios where:\n",
    "   - Different populations have different average BMIs due to diet, lifestyle, or environmental factors\n",
    "   - For example, one population might have higher average BMI due to dietary patterns, even without genetic differences\n",
    "3. **Noise:** We add random noise to make it realistic (representing measurement error and other unmeasured factors)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** The population effect creates confounding because:\n",
    "- Population membership is correlated with genotype (due to different allele frequencies)\n",
    "- Population membership also affects BMI (due to environmental/cultural factors)\n",
    "- This creates a spurious association between genotype and BMI, even for non-causal SNPs!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If Population A has higher average BMI (due to diet) and also happens to have higher frequency of a particular SNP (due to ancestry), the SNP will appear associated with BMI even if it has no causal effect. This is why we need to control for population structure in GWAS."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**BMI = intercept + (SNP effect × genotype) + covariates + error**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're asking: \"Does this genetic variant affect BMI?\" For each of the ~12,000 SNPs, we test whether individuals with different genotypes have different average BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unadjusted GWAS:** No covariates included\n",
    "   - Will show **inflation** (too many significant results) due to population structure\n",
    "   - This demonstrates the problem of confounding\n",
    "   - Many SNPs will appear associated with BMI just because they differ between populations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjusted GWAS:** Includes PC1–PC5 as covariates\n",
    "   - Controls for population structure\n",
    "   - Should show fewer false positives\n",
    "   - Only truly causal SNPs (or SNPs in LD with causal variants) should remain significant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation details:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a fast approach: residualize both BMI and each SNP on the covariates, then test the correlation between the residuals. This is mathematically equivalent to including covariates in the regression but computationally faster.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways and Teaching Points\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Population Structure Causes Confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:**\n",
    "- Different populations have different allele frequencies\n",
    "- If the phenotype also differs between populations (for any reason), you get spurious associations\n",
    "- This creates **false positives** - SNPs that appear significant but aren't truly causal\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:**\n",
    "- Control for population structure using Principal Components (PCs)\n",
    "- Include PCs as covariates in the regression model\n",
    "- This removes the spurious associations while keeping true genetic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Principal Components Capture Population Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first few PCs typically capture major axes of genetic variation\n",
    "- These often correspond to population/ancestry differences\n",
    "- By including PCs as covariates, we control for these differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Manhattan Plots Show Genome-Wide Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each point is a SNP, positioned by genomic location\n",
    "- Height shows -log10(p-value) - higher = more significant\n",
    "- **Towers** of significant SNPs indicate regions with true associations\n",
    "- Towers occur due to **linkage disequilibrium (LD)** - nearby SNPs are correlated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. QQ Plots Diagnose Inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare observed p-values to expected p-values under the null\n",
    "- Points above diagonal = inflation (too many significant results)\n",
    "- Points on diagonal = well-controlled study\n",
    "- The \"tail\" (right side) shows the most significant results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Lambda GC (λGC) Measures Inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "- λGC = 1.0: No inflation (perfect)\n",
    "- λGC > 1.0: Inflation (problem!)\n",
    "- λGC < 1.0: Deflation (also a problem, but less common)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** λGC is useful but not perfect - it can miss some types of confounding, and a well-powered study with true associations will also show some inflation in the tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Real GWAS Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "In real GWAS studies, you should:\n",
    "1. **Quality control (QC):** Filter out low-quality SNPs and samples\n",
    "2. **Control for covariates:** PCs, age, sex, batch effects, etc.\n",
    "3. **Check for inflation:** Use QQ plots and λGC\n",
    "4. **Replication:** Significant findings should be replicated in independent datasets\n",
    "5. **Multiple testing correction:** Use appropriate thresholds (e.g., p < 5×10⁻⁸ for genome-wide significance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions for Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why does the unadjusted GWAS show more significant results?\n",
    "2. How do PCs help reduce false positives?\n",
    "3. What would happen if we didn't control for population structure in a real GWAS?\n",
    "4. Why do we see \"towers\" of significant SNPs rather than isolated points?\n",
    "5. What other factors (besides population structure) could cause inflation in a GWAS?\n"
